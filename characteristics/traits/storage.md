# Decentralized Storage Trait

## Overview

The Decentralized Storage Trait defines the foundational requirements for storing knowledge artifacts in PaperClip using a decentralized, CRDT-based architecture. This ensures reliability, scalability, and seamless integration with other system components while leveraging the benefits of decentralized storage.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Decentralized Architecture**: Eliminates single points of failure by distributing data across nodes.
2. **CRDT-Based Consistency**: Ensures eventual consistency and conflict-free data synchronization.
3. **Scalability**: Handles large datasets and concurrent access seamlessly across distributed nodes.
4. **Extensibility**: Supports custom data models and advanced querying capabilities.
5. **Integration**: Facilitates seamless interaction with other PaperClip components.

## High Availability (HA)

The trait emphasizes high availability through:
1. **Replication**: Data is replicated across nodes to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance.
2. **Conflict Resolution**: CRDTs automatically resolve conflicts, ensuring data integrity.
3. **Backup and Recovery**: Decentralized backups safeguard against data loss.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Tools are integrated to track system health and set up alerts for anomalies.

This decentralized approach ensures the system remains operational under various conditions and scales effectively with the network.
